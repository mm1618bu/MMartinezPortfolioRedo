## ⏰ UPT (Attendance Tracking)

### What is UPT?

UPT = **Unpaid Time** balance. You start with a set number of hours (e.g., 20). Attendance exceptions deduct from your balance.

### Balance Status:

| Status | Balance | What it means |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| 🟢 **Healthy** | > 10 hrs | You're good! |
| 🟡 **Warning** | ≤ 10 hrs | Coaching conversation |
| 🔴 **Critical** | ≤ 5 hrs | Written warning |
| ⚫ **Terminated** | ≤ 0 hrs | Termination review |

### Exception Types:

| Exception | Icon | Deduction |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| Absence | 🚫 | 8 hours |
| Tardiness | ⏰ | Based on minutes late |
| Early Departure | 🏃 | Based on minutes early |
| Extended Break | ☕ | Overage time |
| Missed Punch | 📍 | 0 (warning only) |
| No Call No Show | ❌ | 16 hours (2x penalty) |

### How to Improve:
- Arrive on time
- Clock in/out properly
- Take breaks as scheduled
- Notify manager if absent
- Request PTO in advance

### If Exception is Wrong:
Contact your manager to request an **excuse**. If approved, UPT hours will be refunded.
